          Frank Ocean is a Grammy winning music artist who has released 3 studio albums. At the start of Frank Oceanâ€™s
          career,
          he would ghost write for popular pop artists, providing them lyrics for their songs. Frank decided to venture
          into making
          his own music when joined the rap group Odd Future around 2010. Frank Ocean released his debut mixtape
          Nostalgia Ultra in
          2011 to critical acclaim. <br /></br /> The mixtape focused on sampling other infamous music pieces, while
          Frank put his own lyrics to the
          tracks. Frank became a recluse after the release of his 2012 album Channel Orange, rarely doing interviews,
          rarely sighted in
          public, and rarely releasing music. Frank Ocean is an enigma in the music industry, who rarely performs any
          concerts, does
          interviews or cares about his fame. He famously takes long gaps between releasing music, the opposite of
          industry standards.
