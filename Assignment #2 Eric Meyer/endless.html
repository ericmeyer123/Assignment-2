          Endless was the culmination of a black and white live stream that occurred over several weeks of an empty
          warehouse. At this point
          Frank Ocean had not released any music since 2012, and was about to end his 4 year hiatus. Suddenly the live
          stream began playing
          music, and watchers listened in awe. Frank Ocean entered the livestream, mysteriously wood working. Over the
          course of 45 minutes,
          fans watched as Frank chopped wood with new music backing it. Each song was played over the massive speakers
          in the warehouse he was
          situated in, creating a large echo. Towards the end of the livestream the wood working project was reaching
          its end, as Frank had
          built a large spiral staircase, leading to nowhere. Frank climbed the staircase and the first song on the
          album began playing again,
          thus creating and Endless loop.
          <br /> <br />
          Endless was never put onto any streaming service, or released on iTunes to buy, and the next day Frank
          released another
          album on all services named Blonde. What fans later found out, was that Frank had a record deal with the
          record label Def Jam,
          to release one more album under their label. By releasing Endless and not making it purchasable, the album was
          worthless to Def
          Jam. Essentially Frank had finessed his own record label by releasing an album independently the next day on
          all streaming services,
          assuring that he would make all of the albums profits.
