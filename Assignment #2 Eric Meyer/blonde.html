          Released a day after Endless, Blonde was the album fans had been waiting 4 years for. The album is 17 songs
          and features many
          infamous music artists such as, Beyonce, Andre 3000, Yung Lean, Kanye West, Paul Mccartney, and many more.
          Blonde was unlike anything
          Frank had release before, featuring a minimalist production, and heavy pitch shifting. There are rarely any
          drums on songs from Blonde,
          which makes his vocals carry the album.
